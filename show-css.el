;;; DESCRIPTION AND USAGE
;;
;; Show CSS is a minor mode for emacs.
;;
;; With showcss-mode turned on, as you navigate around an HTML file the
;; matching css for that element will be displayed in another buffer.
;;
;; In the current html buffer, if you move the cursor over a class=".*?"
;; or id=".*?" a buffer will open with the external css file loaded and
;; scrolled to the matching selector.
;;
;; Show Css will look at the <link> tags and a custom comment tag to get
;; the location of external css files.
;;
;; Show Css looks for a comment with this regex:
;; <!-- showcss: \\(.*?\\) -->
;;
;; For example:
;; <!-- showcss: /home/user/projects/facebook/site/css/main.css -->
;; or
;; <!-- showcss: ./sass_files/main.sass-->
;;
;; The comment is useful if you want to use sass files directly instead
;; of compiling them.  Also showcss-mode will only use local files.  So
;; if you use css on a remote server, you will need to use the showcss
;; tag in you html file and have it point to a local copy of that css.


;;; INSTALLATION
;;
;; Put this in your init.el or .emacs file:
;;
;;   (autoload 'showcss-mode "show_css"
;;      "Display the css of the class or id the cursor is at" t)
;;
;; Personally, I find this mode to distracting to use all the time, so I
;; use this function to quickly toggle the mode on and off.
;;
;;   (defun sm/toggle-showcss()
;;     "Toggle showcss-mode"
;;     (interactive)
;;     (if (or (string= major-mode "html-mode")
;;             (string= major-mode "nxml-mode")
;;             (string= major-mode "handlebars-mode"))
