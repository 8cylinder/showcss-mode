** Overview

Show CSS mode for emacs.

With showcss-mode turned on, as you navigate around an HTML file the
matching css for that element will be displayed in another buffer.

In the current html buffer if you move the cursor over a class=".*?"
or id=".*?" a buffer will open with the external css file loaded and
show the matching css.
