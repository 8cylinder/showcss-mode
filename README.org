* Show CSS

In beta. Master branch should be functional, other branches probably won't be.

** Overview

Show CSS mode for emacs.

With showcss-mode turned on, as you navigate around an HTML file the
matching css for that element will be displayed in another buffer.

In the current html buffer if you move the cursor over a class=".*?"
or id=".*?" a buffer will open with the external css file loaded and
show the matching css.

For it to work now, showcss mode looks for this regex in the html file:
  : <!-- showcss: \\(.*\\) -->

For example:
  : <!-- showcss: /home/user/projects/facebook/site/css/main.css -->
or
  : <!-- showcss: ./sass_files/main.sass-->

The file doesn't have to be css, it can be any file that looks like
css, such as sass.

Eventualy showcss mode will look in these places:
  1) The regex in the html file
  2) Read the css tags in the head of the html file
  3) A default location set in Customize. i.e: ./css
  4) A list of locations also set in Customize

** Customize options

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  <alt x>, customize-group, showcss
#+END_SRC

** Todo

  1) Show css from multiple sources
  2) Show css from style attributes that have multiple classes.
     e.g. style="style1 style2 style3"
