* Show CSS


** Overview

Show CSS is a minor mode for Emacs.

With showcss-mode turned on, as you navigate around an HTML file the
matching css for that element will be displayed in another buffer.

All the css will display combined in one buffer and any edits made
there will be sent back to the source css buffer.

*** What doesn't work

All this is a fancy display for some regex searching.  What is does
not do is apply any parsing of the found results to see if it actually
applies to the current tag.

The way it works now, is that for each tag and for each parent tag, it
searches all the associated css buffers for any matches for the tag
name, id name, and any class names.

There is no css parsing, so a selector such as: div ul{} or div > ul{}
won't won't mean anything to showcss.  If your on a div tag, both
those results would be displayed even though they don't apply to the
div tag.

So in short, you get more info that you want.


I am currently investigating how to deal with this.  Some options are:

 1. Use remote debugging with chrome
 2. Find a third party css parser
 3. Write a css parser in Emacs

The first would be the easiest to program, but the most complex for the
user.  They would have to start a browser, load a file in it, then
connect to it from Emacs.  And then the info would be for a file in
the browser, not the edited file in Emacs.  Also (I suspect) that I
couldn't get the specific file location of the css that applies to
the tag so I could display that buffer location in Emacs.

The second option requires the user to install a third party library
or program and has the same drawbacks as the first option.

The third option would be the most difficult to build and realistically
never support all css selectors, only the most common.


** Features

 - Displays a breadcrumb of the current elements parents
 - Displays the css for the current element grouped by file
 - Each field that shows the css is editable, and any changes are sent
   back to the source file
 - <ctrl> x s in the display buffer, saves the source buffers
 - The default mode showcss uses is css-mode, but it can be set to any
   other mode such as sass-mode if your working with sass files
